### ATX Prop. B Camping Ban Tracker
Live site: [digallardox.github.io/prop-B-tracker](digallardox.github.io/prop-B-tracker)

## Project Description
Prop B. is a law passed in Austin that bans public camping. This website pulls data from the Austin Gov website to track the number of police reports for this issue. It renders all the data fields and allows people to filter by specific criteria. When I first made the app, there were under 20 data nodes and now there are over 400.

### MVP/PostMVP

#### MVP
* Render all incident data into cards that displays information.
* allow users to filter by data sets i.e gender, race, etc.
* a learn more page that gives more information about the Prop-B camping ban Offense


#### PostMVP  
* A counter for # of total cases and # of cases by filtered result.
* graphics that visually tell a story i.e a pie chart that shows the percentage of incident by male vs. female.
* 'most active date' function that displays the date with the most incidents.
* potentially more useful data such as D/W/M averages, graphs plotting # of incidents along the date to see if cases are rising or lowering, etc.
